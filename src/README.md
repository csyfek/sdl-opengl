Examples have been pulled from the following sources:

* http://www6.uniovi.es/cscene/CS5/CS5-03.html

These have no other significance other than they were discovered with Google.

Considering these have already been distributed to various parts of the web, modified, and then republished without explicit license notices, in addition to being for education purposes, I don't see much reason to worry about them appearing in this repo.
